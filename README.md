# Pong Game

This Pong Game is a classic arcade-style game implemented in Python using the Tkinter library. The game consists of several modules, each responsible for different aspects of the game.

## Modules

- `main.py`: The main driver for the game, sets up the game window, initializes game components, and manages the game loop.

- `scoreboard.py`: Manages and displays the players' scores during gameplay and provides game-over messages.

- `player.py`: Defines the behavior and control of player paddles.

- `border.py`: Draws the boundary around the game area.

- `ball.py`: Manages the behavior and movement of the game ball.

## How to Play

1. Run `main.py` to start the game.

2. Control the right player's paddle using the 'Up' and 'Down' arrow keys.

3. Control the left player's paddle using the 'w' and 's' keys.

4. Try to bounce the ball back and forth, preventing it from passing your paddle.

5. Earn points when the opponent misses the ball.

6. The game ends when one player scores a predetermined number of points or when the 'Exit' button is clicked.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (included in most Python installations)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Run `main.py` to start the game.



Enjoy the game!
